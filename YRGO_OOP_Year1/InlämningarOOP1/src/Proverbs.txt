Absence makes the heart grow fonder
Actions speak louder than words
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step
Better late than never
Cleanliness is next to godliness
Don’t put off until tomorrow what you can do today
Fortune favors the bold
If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it
Knowledge is power
The pen is mightier than the sword
When the going gets tough, the tough get going
